# Safe Signal - Emergency Alert System

## Project Description
Safe Signal is a React-based web application that provides emergency SOS functionality with offline support using background sync and service workers.

## Key Features
- Geolocation tracking for emergency alerts
- Network status detection (online/offline/poor connection)
- Offline SOS request queuing with background sync
- Automatic retry of failed requests when back online
- Service worker support for PWA capabilities
- IndexedDB for offline data storage

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/safe-signal.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd safe-signal
npm install
```

## Usage
1. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
2. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Workflow
1. **Online Mode**:
   - SOS requests are sent immediately to the server
   - User receives instant confirmation

2. **Offline Mode**:
   - SOS requests are stored in IndexedDB
   - Service worker registers a background sync
   - When connectivity returns, queued requests are automatically sent
   - User receives confirmation when sync completes

## Configuration
- Edit `vite.config.js` for PWA settings
- Modify `EmergencyContext.jsx` for queue handling
- Update `sw.js` for service worker behavior

## Dependencies
- React 19
- Vite
- Workbox (for service workers)
- idb-keyval (for IndexedDB)
- react-hot-toast (for notifications)
